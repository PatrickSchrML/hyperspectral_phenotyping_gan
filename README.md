Hyperspectral phenotyping gan
-----------------------
--- In PREPARATION ---

### Goals:

- [x] Generate hyperspectral signatures (vnir) -- healthy and diseased/stressed
- [x] Unsupervised classification on toy-data (vnir)
- [x] Learn style-(disease)-vector of vnir toy-data
- [x] Generate hyperspectral signatures (uv) -- healthy and diseased/stressed
- [x] Learn style-(disease)-vector of uv toy-data
- [x] Unsupervised classification on toy-data (uv)

- [ ] Learn class related attributes
- [ ] Learn to transform to unseen plants

#
#### Implementation TODOs:
- [ ] Merge implementation of .mat and .hdr datasets
- [ ] Faster reading of .hdr data
